# Portfolio Exercise
Learning HTML/CSS by diving into it. Created a fake portfolio website based on a mockup I designed. Next step: responsive design.

Mockup was designed after an older version of Zara's website. Large graphics, minimalist design, and made sure 
to make text visible on any landing image, unlike Zara's.
